Guild Wars Daily Money ideas from this awful accent person:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGLgRf_28nM

In order of least to most effort:
1. Daily logins (Mystic Coin, Laurels)
2. Alt Parking
3. Time-gated crafting (Ascended materials)
	Ley-Line Infused Tool
	Heat Stone
	Deldrimor Steel Ingot
	Bolt of Damask
	Elonian Leather Square
	more.
4. Home Instance, Guild Hall gathering
	(Acquire time gated Charged Quartz)
	Volatile & Unbound Magic into gold (need LWS3,4 or 4,5, unsure.)
5. Karma to gold via time-gated rotating merchants:

	Requires Tyria mastery.

Not really daily:
Converters:
	https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter
Spirit shards:
	Buy Philosopher's Stone -> Convert T5 to T6 materials.

Actual farming:
	- Istan
	- Silverwastes
	- Fractals
