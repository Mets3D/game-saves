GW2 Ascended/Legendary Gear
Remember to update this list when moving items between characters.

Plans:
	- Get infusions and enrichment and final berserker ring for Necro.
	- WvW reward track enrichment seems best, if we're gonna play WvW a decent amount, since faster reward tracks means faster tomes of knowledge, so more spirit shards.
	- Get an Ascended Staff. Bo is already there, or we can splurge for Zojja's Spire.
