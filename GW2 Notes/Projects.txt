ArcDPS guide: https://phoenixuprising.net/raiding-101-using-arcdps/
**Current GW2 projects:**
	PvE to Raids
		Stop building ascended gear, we might be making a terrible mistake.
			T4 fractals are clearly very easy. I need to find out how easy CM's are, and if I'm fine with my berserker necro there. If they are easy, great, I can move on to Raids. If not, try to find a build I would enjoy that works in both raids and CM's.
		Take notes on how to do each fractal.
	Healer Build (Ascended Magi Armor)
		https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Support_Healer
		https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer
		
		Maybe craft Envoy Armor, so it could be turned into Legendary eventually?
		Step 1: Defeat a Raid Boss.
	Alacrity build 
		This would be this chronomancer https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Utility_Boon_Support
		with Diviner's trinkets (aka Steelstar's) and the berserker armor from the Necro.
		We have a backpiece and I think another 8th birthday gift for the amulet. I wonder if we could buy rings and shit for laurels.
		Even so, infusing a backpiece is 50g (maybe not needed) and agony resistance is 70g...

**Next projects:**
	Join a guild, get them to teach me Raids and do some raiding!
	LWS3 story
	The Icebrood Saga

**Inventory Management**
	- All characters need a Relic, which is a new equipment since Secrets of the Obscure. They got Relic Chests to pick one (or 3). Just look up a build online.
	- Remember we have 2 Equipment Templates, and they could contain gear not otherwise visible.
	Metemer's Inventory Guild Bank
		- Lots of T5 and some T6 materials
		- Should store everything that isn't Account bound (most things are tho)
	
	Necromancer
		- Was my main, so has full berserker high Agony Resistance gear, good for PvE.
		- Reward boosters, Fractal power boosters
		- Items for infusing and salvaging ascended trinkets
	Mesmer
		- Full Exotic berserker gear, although I think I also used to transfer all the ascended gear from the Necro to run Fractals with this char.
	Elementalist
		- Berserker and some alternative gear, with some different stats on trinkets. Used to be for WvW.
		- Also has some stat-selectable ascended trinkets in 1st loadout.
	Thief
		- Salvaged a Berserker's Whisper Secret Pistol and a Warden Dagger of Generosity for the sigil to try and sell, not sure why they're worth 130g when the Superior sigil is 10s.
		- Quartz Crystals to turn into Charged Quartz Crystals daily in the home instance.
	Warrior (used for storage - Would prefer to use Thief for daily salvage, and Engineer for the rest, instead.)
		- Exotic berserker (glass cannon) gear
		- Inventory: Currencies, daily consumables. Can log in daily to:
		- Consume ascended items daily (bloodstone dust, etc)
		- Use Ley Energy Matter Converter (options are random, look for WvW Supplies, Trophy Bag, Large Crafting Bag, Sigil/Rune Bag, Educational Supplies, Rare Gear, Jewels, Obsidian.)
	Ranger (used for storage, don't intend to play)
		- Meme CondiDPS gear (used to run solo cancer build in WvW as a joke)
		- Inventory: Selectable skins, Stat-selectable gear, Gear boxes, Ascended trinkets with stats (that used to be) worth keeping
		- Exotic gear with already selected stats could probably just be salvaged.
		- Skin selection boxes could just be used up arbitrarily.
	Guardian (Empty, don't intend to play)
		- Exotic MixedDPS gear, no idea what for.
		- Healing gear, including ascended trinkets, possibly for WvW.
	Revenant (Empty, don't intend to play)
		- Just some exotic berserker gear. Used to run an Alacrity build in Fractals, but the gear ain't here.
	Engineer (Empty, don't intend to play)
		- No gear at all, only ever used this character in PvP.

**Potential Projects**
	https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raise_the_Banners:_Amnoon_Arbitrator
		Looks like we can complete the Path of Fire story up to 3 times, each time choosing a different thing in chapter 2, and then get an ascended back item for it, with a bonus 4th ascended backpiece if we do all of them.
		That's a lot of ascended back items, wow! But we should definitely at least get the 1st one! Although for now I already have an unused Finite Result...
