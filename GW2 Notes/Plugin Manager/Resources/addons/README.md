# Approved-Addons
### Description

A list of approved addons compatible with the GW2 Addon Manager and GW2 Addon Loader.

The objective of this list is to provide a comprehensive list of add-ons that work with the GW2 Addon Loader and GW2 Addon Manager as well as provide update.yaml files for each.

Update.yaml is intended to serve as a consistent source of information to both the addon manager and the addon loader for configuration, installation, chainloading, etc. of any addon.

A template file can be found here, as well as existing folders displaying what a completed update.yaml file looks like in practice.  A similar list of files (placeholders that I wrote for the addon manager) can also be found in the [addons](https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager/tree/master/application/GW2%20Addon%20Manager/Resources/Addons) folder of the GW2 Addon Manager repository.

### How to Add Your Addon

Submit a PR where you add a folder with the name of your addon (preferably in relatively short and basic form, e.g. gw2radial or arcdps_bhud) with a completed update.yaml file within. See the d912pxy example as a rough guideline.
